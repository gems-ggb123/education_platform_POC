st.markdown('''Geological core data plays a crucial role in understanding the Earth's subsurface and its geological history. It provides valuable insights into the composition, structure, and properties of rocks and sediments.

By analyzing core data, geologists can identify different lithologies, understand depositional environments, and make interpretations about past climate conditions and geological processes.

In this project, we will explore the application of machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret geological core data. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we can uncover hidden patterns, make predictions, and gain valuable insights from this rich dataset.

Let's dive into the fascinating world of geological core data and its applications in geoscience research and exploration!
